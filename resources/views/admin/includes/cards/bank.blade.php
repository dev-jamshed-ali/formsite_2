                        In the case of downgrades due to political risks, it can mean higher capital costs for issuers,
                        and portfolio turnover and losses for investors; most dramatically, however, it can terminate an
                        issuer's access to capital, possibly even leading to default. This necessarily compels an issuer
                        to purchase political risk insurance (PRI), political violence insurance (PVI)[higher premiums],
                        or standalone property terrorism insurance, or some combination thereof depending on the region.

                        Insurance provides investors with the security that no matter what happens to the finances of
                        the government that issues the bond (consent decree expense), the bond's interest and principal
                        payments will be made. Monoline insurers lend their valuable and hard earned ratings to
                        municipalities who use insurance to lower their borrowing costs to pay off its debts. These
                        ratings should be based on political, social, and macro prudential risk analysis within the
                        context of loss mitigation, debt restructuring, or settlement.
